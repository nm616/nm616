Hi, I’m Nigel (aka MoPhaux) 👋

Automation Solutions Architect • Network Engineer • AI Agent Builder

I design systems that automate everything — from data pipelines and APIs to entire business workflows. These days I’m deep into building Agentic AI systems, web automation tools, and multi-stack apps powered by Python, Node, Supabase, Airtable, and Flowise/LLM agents.

I love solving complex problems with clean automation, clever engineering, and a bit of AI magic.

🔧 What I Build

AI-powered agents for data scraping, workflow automation, and orchestration

Full SaaS stacks using Supabase, React/Vite, Node, Docker, NGINX

Airtable automations, MCP servers, and custom integrations (QuickBooks, MemberClicks, etc.)

Network engineering solutions (wireless analysis, VoIP, RTSP, DFS issues, AP tuning)

Web scrapers with Selenium, Playwright, Crawlee, and regex-heavy pipelines

🚀 Current Projects

TriviaVerse — real-time trivia platform (host/player portals, AI question generation, QR join, anti-cheat, analytics)

Elevate Hub — internal AI/automation R&D environment

CCT Project — automated county-level data scraper → Markdown → LLM parsing → vector DB → Airtable sync

AutoFrame — Figma plugin for Airtable-powered card syncing
